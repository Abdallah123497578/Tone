            <p>
                Treaty 1 is an essential agreement that shaped the relationship between First Nations <br> and the Canadian government. it was
                Signed in 1871, it established the topic about land rights, promises, <br> and responsibilities that continue to affect Indigenous communities today. 
                Understanding Treaty 1 helps recognize the historical and ongoing significance of Indigenous rights, reconciliation, 
                and the shared responsibilities of all who live in Canada. <br>
